  <h2>Lingo is now Online</h2>
  <p>
    Lingo was a Dutch television game show produced by AVROTROS (earlier VARA, later TROS). Lingo is a word game that combines the games Mastermind and Bingo. Two teams of two contestants each try to guess and spell words, after being given a letter in the word and the length of the word. The length of the word that has to be guessed varies from five to eight letters, and depends on the round.
    <br/><br/>
    The game show aired daily starting in 1989 on one of Holland's public television channels. On July 30, 2014, it was announced that Lingo would stop producing new episodes starting in September 2014 due to declining ratings.[1] The final episode aired on October 2, 2014.
